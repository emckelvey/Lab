As a young 21 year old developer, a long term goal would be to build a start up or perhaps build mobile
applications as well as online for the whole world to see. A long term goal she has in mind is to develop
certain applications that will help tutor younger kids with math, science, reading, etc. She hopes to build an
interactive app that will also include games that insist on learning how to read, write, and spell.
While showing tutorials for others who many possibly have a career in this field,
being able to come up with different ways or strategies on how to learn the fundamentals
of technology is Ebony's strongest desire.
